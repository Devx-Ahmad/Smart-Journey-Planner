# SJP-Admin-Panel
Admin Panel works hand in hand with Smart Journey Planning Application. It provides a 
management side interface to the Smart Journey Planning solution; add/update routes 
and their status. The web application is created using the popular back-end framework 
Node.js and EJS as template engine for the front-end. All the data is stored in the form of 
documents and MongoDb Cloud Atlas is used for that purpose. Admin Panel is 
responsible for providing CRUD operations for:
- Stops
- Sequences
- Routes
- Trips
- Calendar
